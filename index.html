    <h1> Who am I? </h1>
   
    <p>Hi, I'm Vanessa.</p>
    <p>Here is a little about me : ) </p>

    <p> I like coding, baking, and swimming. One day I want to play a role in designing software applications. There is so much to learn and play with. Whenever there is time I like to learn new skills or practice a previous one. So far I learned to skate, knit/crochet, bake, and taught myself piano. I can't wait to learn about JaveScript
